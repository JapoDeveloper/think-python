Exercise 12.3

Description:

Two words form a “metathesis pair” if you can transform one into the other by 
swapping two letters; for example, “converse” and “conserve”. 
Write a program that finds all of the metathesis pairs in the dictionary. 
Hint: don’t test all pairs of words, and don’t test all possible swaps.

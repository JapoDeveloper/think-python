Exercise 10.8

Description:

This exercise pertains to the so-called Birthday Paradox, which you can read 
about at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox.

If there are 23 students in your class, what are the chances that two of you 
have the same birthday? You can estimate this probability by generating random 
samples of 23 birthdays and checking for matches. Hint: you can generate random 
birthdays with the randint function in the random module.

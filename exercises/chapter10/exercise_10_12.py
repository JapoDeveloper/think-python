Exercise 10.12

Description:

Two words “interlock” if taking alternating letters from each forms a new word. 
For example, “shoe” and “cold” interlock to form “schooled”.

1) Write a program that finds all pairs of words that interlock. 
Hint: don’t enumerate all pairs!

2) Can you find any words that are three-way interlocked; that is, 
every third letter forms a word, starting from the first, second or third?

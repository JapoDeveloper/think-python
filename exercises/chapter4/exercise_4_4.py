Think Python, 2nd Edition
Chapter 4
Exercise 4.4

Description: 

The letters of the alphabet can be constructed from a moderate number of basic 
elements, like vertical and horizontal lines and a few curves. Design an 
alphabet that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic elements and then 
write functions that draw the letters.

You should write one function for each letter, with names draw_a, draw_b, etc., 
and put your functions in a file named letters.py. You can download a 
“turtle typewriter” from http://thinkpython2.com/code/typewriter.py to help you 
test your code.

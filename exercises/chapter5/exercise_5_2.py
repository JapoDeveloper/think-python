Chapter 5
Exercise 5.2

Description: 

Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c 
such that aˆn + bˆn = cˆn for any values of n greater than 2.

1) Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters a, b, c and n
and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If n is greater than 2 and
aˆn + bˆn = cˆn the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!” 
Otherwise the program should print, “No, that doesn’t work.”

2) Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n, 
converts them to integers, and uses check_fermat to check whether they violate 
Fermat’s theorem.

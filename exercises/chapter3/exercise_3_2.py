"""
Think Python, 2nd Edition
Chapter 3
Exercise 3.2

Description: 

A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. 
For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument 
and calls it twice:

def do_twice(f):
    f()
    f()
Here’s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice:

def print_spam():
    print('spam')

do_twice(print_spam)

1. Type this example into a script and test it.

2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value,
and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.

3. Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.

4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, 
passing 'spam' as an argument.

Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value 
and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. 
There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.
